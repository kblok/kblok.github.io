Thanks to all CIs build that made this possible :)

As we were able to ship [v1.17](https://github.com/kblok/puppeteer-sharp/releases/tag/v1.17) late in May, we only shipped a tiny [v1.17.2](https://github.com/kblok/puppeteer-sharp/releases/tag/v1.17.2) version in June.

# What's next

We're now working on v1.18. Doing [evaluations with one trip](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/commit/90df69cf77e88cc4a057cb2ec04b6aa973f568c7) and [OOPIF](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/commit/015e3308155e23282d76b9f846636a5c4eb4e49e support) will be some cool features.

>I want to prepare some examples using Azure Functions. We have many questions related to Puppeteer in Azure. So I think this will be valued by the community.

I'm still working on this. I hope I have more time this month to make some progress.

# Final Words

As I mentioned in previous posts, the more hands we have in this project, the easier for us to help you out with issues and improvements.

I'm looking forward to getting more feedback. Having real-world feedback helps us a lot. The issues tab in GitHub is open for all of you to share your ideas and thoughts. You can also follow me on Twitter [@hardkoded](https://twitter.com/hardkoded).

Don't stop coding!
