As you may have heard, Microsoft Launched made available to the public its [Chromium-powered Edge browser](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/).

So, maybe this question won't qualify for a technical interview but:

>If Puppeteer-Sharp automates Chromium and Microsoft Edge (insider) is powered by chromium, that would mean that

![Idea](https://media.giphy.com/media/B5AVgxf0OzlyE/giphy.gif)

When you call `Puppeteer.LaunchAsync`, one of the properties in `LaunchOptions` is an (optional) [ExecutablePath](https://www.puppeteersharp.com/api/PuppeteerSharp.LaunchOptions.html#PuppeteerSharp_LaunchOptions_ExecutablePath).

What would happen if we launch a browser passing our Microsoft Edge browser path?

```cs
var browser = await Puppeteer.LaunchAsync(new LaunchOptions
{
    Headless = true,
    ExecutablePath = "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge Dev\\Application\\msedge.exe"
});
```

Let's write a super simple example:

```cs
var browserOptions = new LaunchOptions
{
    Headless = false,
    ExecutablePath = "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge Dev\\Application\\msedge.exe"
};

var browser = await Puppeteer.LaunchAsync(browserOptions);
var page = await browser.NewPageAsync();

await page.SetContentAsync("<div>Testing</div>");
```

Voil√†!

And after a [few tweaks](https://github.com/kblok/puppeteer-sharp/pull/1074) (only in tests) in puppeteer-sharp, and [one similar change](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/pull/4314) in puppeteer, we managed to get all tests running using Microsoft Edge!

So we can say that Puppeteer-Sharp v1.14 is fully compatible with Microsoft Edge Insider version 75.0.131.0.

Don't stop coding!
