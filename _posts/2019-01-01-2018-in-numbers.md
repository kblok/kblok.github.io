Yesterday I tweeted [my 2018 in numbers](https://twitter.com/hardkoded/status/1079849765939097602), and I thought it deserves a post :)

The goal of this post is not showing off. It's to encourage you to do the same, to give back, to help the community that already helped you to become a better developer.

# Final Words

You might say: **"That sounds good, but I don't have time for that"**, and you know what? **THAT'S OK**. But there is one thing you can do: **Encourage others**:
 * Start a project that was helpful in Github 
 * Upvote questions and answers on Stack Overflow.
 * Add a thank you comment on a post that was useful.

Don't stop coding!
