I'm super excited to share with you that yesterday I was announced I had received the Microsoft MVP Award!

![award](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kblok/kblok.github.io/master/img/mvp/mvp.png)

I think the timing is perfect. Last year, my talk "You can also be a hero" was born. I was able to give that talk twice: At [Age of Mobile](https://ageofmobile.tech/) in Buenos Aires (big thanks to [Esteban](https://twitter.com/Teban3010) and [Leo](https://twitter.com/sebaleoperez)) and [vOpen UY](https://uy.vopen.tech/) (thanks to all the vOpen crew!). This year I will give the English version for the first time at [HolyJS](https://holyjs-piter.ru/en/), Russia!!! (online ðŸ˜ž) and at the [WebConf](https://twitter.com/webconfar) in CÃ³rdoba.

And I think it's all about that. It's about being little heroes where you are. Did I dream about this award? Yes, sure? But I never worked for the award. I worked for the community, to give back. I won't talk more about this, that's what the hero talk is about ðŸ˜œ.

I want to thank [Nico Milcoff](https://twitter.com/nmilcoff) for opening this door and guide me through the process, Thank you Nico!

I hope this award opens more doors to keep helping what I consider one of the best communities in the world: The developer's community.
