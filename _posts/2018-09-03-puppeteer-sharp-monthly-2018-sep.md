No, we didn't miss the August Report, I just had my deserved vacation :), but we are back and ready to puppeteer!
Let's see what we accomplished in the past two months. We released 4 versions: [1.2](https://github.com/kblok/puppeteer-sharp/releases/tag/v1.2), [1.3](https://github.com/kblok/puppeteer-sharp/releases/tag/v1.3), [1.4](https://github.com/kblok/puppeteer-sharp/releases/tag/v1.4) and [1.5](https://github.com/kblok/puppeteer-sharp/releases/tag/v1.5). I invite you to follow the links and read all the changes we made in each version.

# What's next

Trying to catch Puppeteer always feels like a never ending race and, in fact, it is. Puppeteer is an active and growing project and when we feel that we are almost there they release a new version. But we are almost there! :)

We are only 4 versions back (at the moment of writing this post), and we have a plan for each of them:

* [1.6](https://github.com/kblok/puppeteer-sharp/projects/21) (In progress)
* [1.6.1](https://github.com/kblok/puppeteer-sharp/projects/22)
* [1.6.2](https://github.com/kblok/puppeteer-sharp/projects/23)
* [1.7](https://github.com/kblok/puppeteer-sharp/projects/24)

# Progress

* Google Puppeteer’s tests: 699
* Puppeteer Sharp’s tests: 436 (prev. 370)

# Activity 

* Repository Stars: 194 (prev. 139) +39%
* Repository Forks: 41 (prev. 17) +141% :o
* Nuget downloads: 10436 (prev. 4785) +118% :o :o
* Contributors: 3

# Contributors

[Meir Blachman](https://www.twitter.com/MeirBlachman) pushed 28 PRs out of 72 and reviewed all my PRs. We kept the project moving while I was on holidays, I really appreciate his help.

[xMarkos](https://github.com/xMarkos) stepped in implementing two super important changes:
 * First, something I knew we had to do sooner or later which is [adding ConfigureAwait(false) in all of our awaits](https://github.com/kblok/puppeteer-sharp/pull/525)
* Second, something I didn't know about, he implemented [true async calls in file handling](https://github.com/kblok/puppeteer-sharp/pull/526).

[Tim Watkins](https://github.com/jankcat) Also stepped in and helped us to fix some outdated docs we had.

# Final Words

xMarkos showed me once again how important is for my professional career to be involved in open source projects. You are always learning from people you never met or spoke with. If you are not participating in any open source project, I really encourage you to start doing it.

I'm also thrilled for those 10k downloads, your support not only arouses a smile on my face but also motivates us to keep working on this project.

I’m looking forward to getting more feedback. The issues tab in GitHub is open for all of you to share your ideas and thoughts. You can also follow me on Twitter @hardkoded.

Don't stop coding!
