May was a month full of releases. We shipped [v1.15](https://github.com/kblok/puppeteer-sharp/releases/tag/v1.15), [v1.16](https://github.com/kblok/puppeteer-sharp/releases/tag/v1.16), [v1.17](https://github.com/kblok/puppeteer-sharp/releases/tag/v1.17) and a small [v1.17.1](https://github.com/kblok/puppeteer-sharp/releases/tag/v1.17.1).

# What's next

I want to prepare some examples using Azure Functions. We have a lot of questions related to Puppeteer in Azure. So I think this will be valued by the community.

# Final Words

As I mentioned in previous posts, the more hands we have in this project, the easier for us to help you out with issues and improvements.

I'm looking forward to getting more feedback. Having real-world feedback helps us a lot. The issues tab in GitHub is open for all of you to share your ideas and thoughts. You can also follow me on Twitter [@hardkoded](https://twitter.com/hardkoded).

Don't stop coding!
