>Now that we (almost) catch Puppeteer, I wonder whether this monthly report will still be useful or not in the future. However, I think it’s an excellent place to thank the contributors who stepped in and also the users who join this community.

This is how I closed the [report](https://www.hardkoded.com/blog/puppeteer-sharp-monthly-oct-2018) last month. It was a pleasant surprise to get this comment (I don't get many comments on my blog) a few days after I published th post.

So here we are, welcome to the November report. We shipped [v1.8](https://github.com/hardkoded/puppeteer-sharp/releases/tag/v1.8) and [v1.9](https://github.com/hardkoded/puppeteer-sharp/releases/tag/v1.9) during October. We shared the same version with [our mother project Puppeteer](https://github.com/googleChrome/puppeteer) for over a week. However, this morning (November 2nd), they released [v1.10](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/releases/tag/v1.10.0) with an awesome feature: [Accessibility](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/v1.10.0/docs/api.md#class-accessibility). We have work to do!

One small milestone was introducing [burst mode screenshots](https://github.com/hardkoded/puppeteer-sharp/pull/705). I consider it a milestone because it's the first feature asked by the community and implemented in Puppeteer-Sharp before the mother project.

# What's next

[Bilal Durrani](https://github.com/bdurrani) stepped into the project during October. He suggested we needed more code examples. I said "Of course! Let's go for it.". So, during this month we are going to have, not only a samples project on our repo but also an examples section on the site. Did you know we have a [site](https://www.puppeteersharp.com/)?

We had a little debate there, whether we should have examples on the site, or in real runnable code. We are going to do both. I think Google will do a great job crawling our site and, at the same time, you will be able to download those samples from the repo and play with them. I'm super excited about this.

I hope we can also release v1.10. I have the feeling that Google's teams are releasing one version per month, so that's a good thing, because it give us some time for housekeeping.

We are also working hard with a few users on heavy usage scenarios. We will have some good improvements in performance and stability in the next release.

# Progress
This will be the last time I publish a tests comparison between these two projects. I will do a final review to see if we have some missing tests on our side. They have some Node related tests, and we have some .NET related tests, and it doesn't worth the effort to keep comparing these 2 numbers.

* Google Puppeteer’s test: 493
* Puppeteer Sharp’s tests: 499 (prev. 482)
