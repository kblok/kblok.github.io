We were able to ship [v1.12](https://github.com/kblok/puppeteer-sharp/releases/tag/v1.12) in February, ok it was in March, but let me count this as February :p

Puppeteer v1.12 included quite an interesting refactor, introducing [Worlds](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/62.0.3178.1/third_party/WebKit/Source/bindings/core/v8/V8BindingDesign.md#world). This took us some time to adapt our code to that new implementation.

# What's next

I bet Puppeteer v1.13 is around the corner, as they ship as soon as I write these reports :p

I wasn't able to work on  this during February:
>Another issue that is driving me crazy is [UnobservedTaskExceptions](https://github.com/kblok/puppeteer-sharp/issues/891). Brian Feucht found out that tons of UnobservedTaskExceptions are being logged. Though there are not many user tracking that I think that's something we do need to work on.

I hope I can work on that this month.

# Final Words

We've got 6 contributors in February! I can't believe that. You are welcome to step in the project or continue working on it ;). There are many ideas I want to work on. This project needs more hands.

Iâ€™m looking forward to getting more feedback. Having real-world feedback helps us a lot. The issues tab in GitHub is open for all of you to share your ideas and thoughts. You can also follow me on Twitter [@hardkoded](https://twitter.com/hardkoded).

Don't stop coding!
