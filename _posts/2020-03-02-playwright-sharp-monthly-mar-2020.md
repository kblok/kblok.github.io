As I mentioned in my [previous post](https://www.hardkoded.com/blog/its-playwright-time), 2020 will be about Playwright!

# The plan

We have a clear plan:

## Target version

Our focus is on [v0.10.0](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/tree/v0.10.0), which is not the latest version, but it was when we started working on Puppeteer-Sharp.
We can't implement Playwright-Sharp looking at Playwright's master branch because it's moving every day. We will work against a snapshot, in this case, v0.10.0, and when we get there, we will see what's the latest version, try to get there, and so on.

## Tests first

As I [mentioned before](https://www.hardkoded.com/blog/its-playwright-time), we are going to code all tests first. This will give us a clear picture of our progress.

# Progress

 * Playwright's tests: 905
 * Playwright Sharp's tests coded: 627
   * Passing on Chromium: 6
   * Passing on Webkit: 0
   * Passing on Firefox: 0
  
# Activity

 * Repository Stars: 22
 * Repository Forks: 3
 * Nuget downloads: 0
 * Contributors: 2

# Contributors

[Meir Blachman](https://twitter.com/MeirBlachman) was a key contributor on Puppeteer-Sharp. I'm so glad he jumped in on this project. He pushed 17 commits this month.

# I need you

Maybe we don't have the time to jump in and put some hours on this project. That's ok. But if you are interested in this project, there are two things you can do:

**Star** the project. That's free, and it will give me an idea of the interest in this project.

**Financial support**. I'm doing this for free because I love this project, and I want to give back to the community. But financial funding it's an excellent way to honor my work if my projects are making your business possible. So if you are willing to support my projects, you can visit my [open collective page](https://opencollective.com/hardkoded-projects).

# Final words

I hope I can ship some version in a few weeks so you can download it and play a little bit.
Don't forget to follow me on Twitter [@hardkoded](https://twitter.com/hardkoded) to get more updates.

Don't stop coding!
